# INFO443 Project 1

For this project, I decided to use my previous project from INFO340 called **Dub Dumps**. It was originally created by me and my team working on the final project for the class. The project is a React app that simulates a website for UW students looking for the nearest avaliable bathrooms on campus, with login authentication, filtering, and map capabilities.  

A candidate element I was thinking about to analyze for architectual quality would probably be the filter and search functions on the search page.
